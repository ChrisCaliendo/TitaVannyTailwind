          WHO WE ARE
        </p>
        <p className=" text-white pb-3 text-2xl">
          Career Advantage is a full-service staffing agency that provides comprehensive
          staffing solutions in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas.  We began in 2001 as a
          two person search firm and have been on a journey of growth since.  After taking stock
          of who we are and where we’ve been, one thing became clear; maintaining the status quo
          was no way to run a business. We realized to keep growing, we’d have to be infinitely
          more invested. In our own people, clients, and candidates. In everything we do, every
          single day. So we made a commitment to do exactly that. And we’ve remained true to it ever since.
        </p>


        <p className=" text-white py-3 pt-10 text-2xl">
          No matter what position you’re looking to fill, you can be confident every candidate we
          present will be more qualified, more skilled and more of what you are looking for. If you’re
          looking for work, you can be confident that our clients have highly desirable positions that
          you may not find using typical job search methods.  And that we have the relationships and
          connections to expose you to the industries and positions you want.
        </p>

        <p className=" text-white py-3 pt-10 text-2xl ">
          Career Advantage is excited to show you - our clients and candidates - who we are, where we are
          going and how we are going to get there!  Come along for the ride!

          What drives us?  Your success, for one thing. (If you don’t succeed, we don’t either.) But also, our
          belief in respect, integrity, trust, accountability and passion in all our dealings, business or
          otherwise. Yes, adhering to these core beliefs keep us in check, and even help us sleep better at night.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-white py-3 pt-10 text-2xl">
          Career Advantage believes in the importance of building our organization on a foundation of respect,
          integrity, trust, accountability and passion in all of our business dealings.  We respect one another,
          our clients, and our candidates with a focus of establishing long lasting partnerships. These partnerships
          are built on us being true to our word, accountable for our actions, and passionate about what we do and
          why we do it.

          The result?  Long-lasting and trusting relationships that withstand the test of time.  Our 16 year presence in

          of an unwavering customer-first philosophy.
